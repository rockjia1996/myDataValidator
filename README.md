# Python Data Validator

## Description
This project is inspired by a Javascript data validation library named [joi.js](https://joi.dev/). When I was working on some of my web projects, I found that joi.js is a quite powerful and easy to use data validation library. I like the schema based approach to handle the data validation problem that I encounted. However, the library is written in Javascript, but some of my web projects are written in Python. I decided to emulate some of the features in joi.js by rewriting some of the functionalities in Python 3. 

In the future, there may have more extensions on functionalities. The extensions are not only limited to emulate some of the features in joi.js but also anything data validation task that worth enough to dedicatedly generalize in this library.
